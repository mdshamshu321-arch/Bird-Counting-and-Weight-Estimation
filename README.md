# Bird-Counting-and-Weight-Estimation
This project builds a computer vision prototype that analyzes fixed-camera poultry CCTV footage to detect and track birds for real-time counting and estimate bird weight using a visual size-based proxy. Includes detection, tracking, temporal counts, and a scalable approach for weight calibration with real-world data.
